It's a first task to create a repository in Github Desktop.
Difference b/w Git and Github 
- Git is a CLI Software to be installed on computers whereas Github Desktop is a Web application.
- Github is known for distributed version control, for each change is captured with unique commit ID.
- Master or Main both are same, this branch has a working copy of code in production. It's a Main Folder.
- You can create branch(s) under Main/Master repository. It's more like Sub Folder, it contains the all Master content cloned to the newly created branch. It's isolated from the main code.
- Pull request, sending commit change to peer-review.
- You can review and do require change in branch level, and commit the changes to Main/Master after all required check-lists passed and reviewed by peers.
    - While Merging three options there, Merge and Squash.
    - If you would like to keep all commit ID present in branch level while merging to Master/Main
    - Squash If you would like to ignore all commits in Branch, and merge to Master/Main as a single Commit.
 
- You can download the Git installer from https://git-scm.com/downloads for respective operating system.
